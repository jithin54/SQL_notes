normal primary key
PRIMARY KEY (emp_id);

PRIMARY KEY (emp_id, emp_name)


creating foreign key
--------------------

FOREIGN KEY (branch_allotted) REFERENCES branch(branch_id) 
ON DELETE SET NULL;

this creation of foreign key is normally done after creating the table
because some of the table would not be created at the time of creation of a table

ALTER TABLE employee
ADD FOREIGN KEY (branch_allotted) REFERENCES branch(branch_id) 
ON DELETE SET NULL;
